ASL Recognition with Teachable Machine and Text-to-Speech Integration


Overview:

This JavaScript code utilizes Teachable Machine for image recognition and computer vision to interpret American Sign Language (ASL) gestures captured in images. The program identifies hand gestures in images and translates them into text, displaying the corresponding word on the webpage. Furthermore, it integrates with the RapidAPI Text-to-Speech API to convert the recognized word into audio format, enabling users to hear the pronunciation of the interpreted ASL word.


Features:
- Teachable Machine Integration: Incorporates Teachable Machine's machine learning model to recognize ASL gestures from images.
- Computer Vision: Utilizes computer vision techniques to detect and interpret hand gestures accurately.
- ASL to Text Translation: Converts recognized ASL gestures into text, displaying the corresponding word on the webpage.
- Text-to-Speech Integration: Utilizes the RapidAPI Text-to-Speech API to generate audio files of the interpreted ASL word.
- User-Friendly Interface: Provides a simple and intuitive interface for users to upload images and interact with the ASL recognition system.


Requirements:

Modern web browser with JavaScript support.
Internet connection to access Teachable Machine and RapidAPI services.
